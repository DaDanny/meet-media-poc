# Google Meet Media API - Samples

## Overview

The Google Meet Media API lets you access real-time media from Google Meet
conferences. For more information, see the [Meet Media API overview](https://developers.google.com/meet/media-api/guides/overview).

This repository contains two reference implementations of the Google Meet Media
API, written in **TypeScript** and **C++**, along with various samples. These
demonstrate recommended practices for using the API.

You may build upon these clients directly, or you might use them as guides to
build a custom client in another language.
